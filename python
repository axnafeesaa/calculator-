if __name__ == "__main__":
    calculator()

How it works:
1) You enter calculations like 5 + 7, 12 / 4, 3 * 8, or 10 - 2.

2) The program evaluates the expression using eval but disables builtins for safety.

3) Each successful calculation is appended to calc_log.txt with the format:
3 + 4 = 7

4) Enter exit to quit the program.

The objective of this calculator project is to design and implement a simple yet functional
calculator that allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations, while reinforcing core programming skills, 
input validation, error handling, and optional logging of results. 
This project also serves as an introduction to collaborative software development using GitHub.
